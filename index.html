        <h2>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment from Microsoft.
             It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services
              and mobile apps.
        </h2>
        <h3>Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component)
             as well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and
              a machine-level debugger. Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building
               GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer. It accepts
                plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including adding support for
                 source control systems (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets like editors and
                  visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software
                   development lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).
